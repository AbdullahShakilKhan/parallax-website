    <p>It is the hottest season of the year. In some places, summer is the wettest season (with the most rain), and
        in other places, it is a dry season. Four seasons are found in areas which are not too hot or too cold.
        Summer happens to the north and south sides of the Earth at opposite times of the year.In the north part of
        the world, summer takes place between the months of June and September, and in the south part of the world,
        it takes place between December and March. This is because when the north part of the Earth points towards
        the Sun, the south part points away.</p>

        <h1 class="main-heading">Winter</h1>



    </div>

    <p>Winter is one of the four seasons and it is the coldest time of the year. The days are shorter, and the nights
        are longer. Winter comes after autumn and before spring.

        Winter begins at the winter solstice. In the Northern Hemisphere the winter solstice is usually December 21 or
        December 22. In the Southern Hemisphere the winter solstice is usually June 21 or June 22.</p>

    <div class="box3">

        <h1 class="main-heading">Autumn</h1>



    </div>


    <p> Autumn is the season after summer and before winter. In the United States and Canada, this season is also called
        fall. In the Northern Hemisphere, it is often said to begin with the autumnal equinox in September and end with
        the
        winter solstice in December. In the Southern Hemisphere, it runs from the autumnal equinox in March to the
        winter
        solstice in June. </p>

    <div class="box4">

        <h1 class="main-heading">Spring</h1>



    </div>

    <p> Spring is the season after winter and before summer. Days become longer and the weather gets warmer in the
        temperate zone because Earth tilts relative to it is orbital plane around the Sun. In many parts of the world,
        it rains for hours. This helps the plant grow and flower bloom. Often people with hay fever suffer more because
        some plant pollen is allergen. Many animals have their breeding season in spring-type weather. At the start of
        spring, a person suffering from seasonal affective disorder will feel sick. The vernal equinox in springtime
        makes day and night equally long in temperate zone. </p>
